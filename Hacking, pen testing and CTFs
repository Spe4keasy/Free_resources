The Cyber Mentor
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0ArlFuFYMpEewyRBzdLHiw/playlists

The Cyber Mentor has some awesome instructional playlists including 'Zero to Hero' which teach you the basics of penetration testing
and assumes no prior knowledge. It starts from setting up a lab environment, touches on using python and goes as far as active directory
attacks.
His Buffer Overflow series is also really good, although some of the initial code didn't work for me so feel free to get in touch 
if you'd like some pointers/a fix.

Over The Wire
https://overthewire.org/wargames/

Awesome for learning the basics of command line and the power it holds. It starts at a basic level (reccomend startign with the Bandit
challenge) and progresses in difficulty while providing links to resources to learn about the challenge.

Root-ME
https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en

Similar to Over The Wire but has a broader range ofchallenges including crypt, Stegonography and web app. again it provides links to learn
about the challenge you're trying to complete.

# Free_resources
A list of free (or as good as) training resources handy during the lockdown.

This list has been quickly put together (so not spell checked...), I've used a lot of the resources myself and may be bias towards some over others. But at the same time others I'm only aware of and have no personal experience in.

Everything should be free! If you're asked to pay for something do a sanity check and make sure you've followed the right link and checked there isn't a free version somehwere else (for example when downloading VMware).

Also be sensible when providing personal details etc.

The JHub scheme does require the purchase of some courses but as you can make money back from successfully completing the course and assessment I deem this to be as good as (infact better than) free.
